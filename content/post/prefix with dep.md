Today I'm excited to drop a hot new collaboration (the site's first) with my lovely partner zel, who just recently debuted her own site over at [puz-zel.com](https://puz-zel.com/).<!--more-->  Go check it out, because her first full size puzzle is fresh, smooth, and not *not* filled with some of the fun adult references that are common here.

What's today's puzzle about?  Well... the thumbnail is a hint and so, too, is the title.

The backstory here is that I noticed a spelling error on a themer after finishing the original grid solo, and lost steam on it.  Happily, zel was there to offer some love, help with a complete redo of the fill, and many of her own delightful angles on the clue set.
