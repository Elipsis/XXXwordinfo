Hello fellow young person solvers.  As a hip and very "with it" constructor myself I know the sort of contemporary content that cool modern people (like us) love to see in puzzles.  In fact I regularly solve the New York Times digitally on my personal computer and therefore am very "plugged in" to all the new and exciting ways people just like you and I are using technology to communicate.

Because my dream as a constructor is to Submit to Will Shortz I have studied the aforementioned puzzles carefully and spoken with my peers using the Internet on a website called [/r/crossword](https://reddit.com/r/crossword/) to learn about everyone's favorite sorts of fill and find inspiration for my latest themed puzzle.

I have learned very much about the act of (NYT) Submission.  I hope you enjoy my fresh content.
