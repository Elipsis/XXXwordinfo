They say that you never forget your first.  I know I won't.  

*My* first collaborator was Norah Sharpe, and that creative process taught me a ton about puzzle construction and helped inspire me to create a site of my own.

For this reason I was delighted when Norah reached out to me about the possibility to guest host her especially lascivious grid.
Norah says:
*"This puzzle needed adopting and there is no better place than XXXWordinfo for this very not-G-rated baby. I'm calling this Seven as it's #7 in my [NaCroWriMo](https://www.norahsharpe.com/search/label/NaCroWriMo) series. So grateful to Elipsis for hosting me."*
